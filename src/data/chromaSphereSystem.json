            "description": ["Hew Espireth, known as Hespeth or the sleeper fields, is the huge central sphere around which the Chroma Sphere System rotates. Its gigantic lifelight core is encased by translucent, violet rock. Silver sand covers its glowing surface, which is visible from Pyro Eshwelle. Residents view their world using Godish mechancial eyes or Evollese enchantment. Like all Chroman spheres, Hew Espireth has a breathable atmosphere. Within the stone surface, several layers of subterranean chambers contain homes, workspaces and massive chambers of delusion cells", "Residents of Hew Espireth, known as the Hespers, fall into four categories: retirees, creators, workers and priests.", "Retirees are Chromans kept in induced stasis within delusion cells. Most Chromans who volunteer for mindscape research missions become retirees upon completion of their parallel life, regardless of the mission's length, due to the psychological damage caused by mindscaping. Safe within a delusion cell, retirees dream away the remainder of their existence.", "Creators design delusion cell dreamworlds. Before the original portal tech was lost in the First Fall, they designed real worlds in distant galaxies. They created all Chroman spheres except Peblash Reck.", "Workers assist the creators and priests, performing general maintenance. Hew Espireth's rigorous screening process blocks anyone with a criminal past or deadlight energy, due to the retirees' vulnerability. Positions on Hespeth remain highly valued due to high living standards and potential for creator training.", "Priests oversee delusion cell allocation and final death rites. Retirees tired of delusion can request funerals, where they are transported to volcanic lands and lowered into molten rock, where their consciousness dissolves, becoming part of the lifelight core.", "No Chromans are born Hew Espireth. Despite the abundance of lifelight, the proximity to death makes all residents infertile, and no food grows on Hew Espireth soil. Lifelight energy eliminates hunger, but residents who enjoy eating receive imported food from other spheres. The lack of native food makes Hew Espireth residents the most varied in appearance, retaining the physical characteristics acquired during their previous residence. Most priests arrive from the green forest planet of Geren Espher. Most creators are violet from lives spent studying magic on Evol Espireth, or indigo from studying science on Godshi Enpire.", "The last ruler of Hew Espireth was Giyakai, who ruled from GE1959 until the GWAKZ war's dramatic conclusion. Like all Chroman spheres, Hew Espireth is now governed by non-hierarchical committee. "]
