            "description": ["Hew Espireth, known as Hespeth or the sleeper fields, is the huge central sphere around which the Chroma Sphere System rotates. Its gigantic lifelight core is encased by translucent, violet rock. Silver sand covers its glowing surface. This sunlike sphere is visible from Pyro Eshwelle, and to avoid blindness, residents view their world using Godish mechancial eyes or Evollese enchantment. Like every Chroman sphere, Hew Espireth has a breathable atmosphere. Within the stone surface, several layers of subterranean chambers contain homes, workspaces and massive chambers of delusion cells. Residents of Hew Espireth, known as the Hespers, fall into four categories: sleepers, creators, workers and priests.", "Sleepers are Chromans kept in induced stasis within delusion cells. Most Chromans who volunteer for mindscape research missions become sleepers upon completion of their parallel life, regardless of the mission's length, due to the psychological damage caused by mindscaping. Safe within a delusion cell, sleepers dream away their remaining existence.", "Creators design delusion cell dreamworlds. Before the original portal tech was lost in the First Fall, they designed real worlds in distant galaxies. They created all Chroman spheres except Peblash Reck.", "Priests oversee delusion cell allocation and final death rites. Sleepers tired of delusion can request funerals, where they are transported to volcanic lands and lowered into molten rock, where their consciousness dissolves, becoming part of the lifelight core.", "Workers assist the creators and priests, performing general maintenance. Hew Espireth's rigorous screening process blocks anyone with a criminal past or deadlight energy, due to the sleepers' vulnerability. Positions on Hespeth remain highly valued due to incredible living standards and potential for creator training.", "No Chromans are born Hew Espireth. Despite the abundance of lifelight, the proximity to death makes all residents infertile, and no food grows on Hew Espireth soil. Lifelight energy eliminates hunger, but residents who still enjoy eating receive imported food from other spheres. The lack of native food makes Hew Espireth residents the most varied in appearance, retaining the physical characteristics acquired during their previous residence. Most priests arrive from the green forest planet of Geren Espher. Most creators are violet from lives spent studying magic on Evol Espireth, or indigo from studying science on Godshi Enpire.", "The last ruler of Hew Espireth was Giyakai, who ruled from GE1959 until the GWAKZ war's dramatic conclusion. All Chroman spheres are now governed by non-hierarchical committee."]

They construct beautiful homes from locally materials using 'nesis. Wealthy Evollese inhabit mountaintop palaces overlooking the clouds. Poorer residents work in the lowlands, farming the violet foods that give residents their colour.", "The Evollese have the strongest teleskills of all Chromans except the Hesper creators. Other Chromans sometimes perceive their cold, distant manner as arrogant. Before the First Fall, the Evollish teleported to distant galaxies and nudged the development of sentient beings to advance them toward self awareness. Modern day Evollish of notable talent will 'port across Chroma teaching teleskills and assisting large building and landscaping projects using 'nesis", "The last ruler of Evol Espireth was Wandasee, who took power three years before the GWAKZ war. The previous ruler was Reea, who changed her name to Recka when she left Evol for Peblash Reck, having succumbed to the deadlight."]

As with Hew Espireth, underground space is often utilised, mostly for vast subterrenean fields of portal doors.", "The Godish culture is focussed around science and creating machines that surpass the abilities of the Chroman mind. They build simple homes using 'nesis and machinery. Their indigo food is farmed by robots, as most Godish work in laboratories or libraries. These quiet, studious Chromans rarely leave their sphere, and prefer electronic communication to receiving guests. Their main visitors are mindscape researchers.", "Mindscape research positions are open to any Chroman who passes the online tests. Researchers are allocated a portal door upon arrival, which they step through, merging with a newborn consciousness in a parallel universe and creating another mindscape in the mindfields. Upon mission completion, the researcher's door reactivates and they return to Godshi Enpire where their memories are added to the electronic library. Researchers usually return physically altered to resemble the distant lifeform they merged with. Some return to Chroman life, or undertake further research missions. Many are so consumed with a distant world's idea of what happens at mission end, the Godish walk them straight into delusion cells and ship them to Hew Espireth. Others return having committed heinous crimes in their parallel life and are sent to Pred Heres.", "Godshi was the primary target during the Second Fall, where the Reckish stole portal technology to create CRIBs. The following four hundred years brought a re-build and major advances in portal technology, prompting the Reckish to attack again.", "The last ruler of Godshi Enpire was Isiah, voted into leadership seven years before the GWAKZ war. This war began with Reckish stealing more Godish research before destroying many portal doors. Researchers were stranded on collapsing mindscapes upon mission completion until the intervention of Bure Eshpel spaceships. Surviving Godish are still working hard to rebuild the portal doors and again advance their technology beyond Reckish capabilities."]
